Goal: Systematic Remediation of High, Medium, and Low Security Vulnerabilities
Objective
Ensure the security and integrity of Jira and ConnectALL applications by systematically identifying, categorizing, and remediating high, medium, and low security vulnerabilities.

Deliverables
Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment

Conduct automated security scans (OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, Nessus) to detect vulnerabilities.
Perform manual security testing for business-critical components.
Categorize vulnerabilities into High, Medium, and Low based on risk impact.
High-Risk Vulnerability Remediation (Critical & High)

Fix SLA: Resolve within 2-4 weeks based on criticality.
Apply security patches for Jira and ConnectALL immediately.
Address authentication flaws, misconfigurations, and exposed endpoints.
Ensure all APIs and integrations follow security best practices.
Medium-Risk Vulnerability Fixes

Fix SLA: Resolve within 30-60 days to prevent future exploitation.
Optimize access controls, session handling, and encryption standards.
Upgrade outdated libraries, plugins, and third-party dependencies.
Low-Risk Vulnerability Cleanup & Hardening

Fix SLA: Resolve within 90 days to enhance overall security posture.
Improve logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms.
Enforce secure coding practices and prevent minor security loopholes.
Ongoing Security Governance & Compliance

Implement continuous security monitoring and regular security audits.
Establish a vulnerability management process with tracking and reporting.
Align remediation efforts with ISO 27001, SOC2, GDPR, and internal compliance policies.
Security Awareness & Developer Training

Conduct security training for developers and admins on best practices.
Document remediation strategies and establish a security playbook.
Host quarterly security review meetings to track progress.
Measures of Success
✅ 100% Remediation of High-Risk Vulnerabilities within SLA.
✅ 80%+ Reduction in Medium & Low Vulnerabilities in 6 months.
✅ Zero Critical Security Incidents post-remediation.
✅ Improved Compliance Score in security audits.
✅ Security Awareness: Conduct at least 2 training sessions per year.
